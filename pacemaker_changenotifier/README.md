### TODO

- Add a Provider for Navigation
- Avoid creating two separate Lists vor the Tabs 'Schedule' and 'History'
  - _workouts list has to be provided via Selector
  - how can I, below provider, have two screens?
  - ValueListenableBuilder  
  - call Selector <WorkoutListModel,List Workout> with sorted List of each Tab

- Add AnimationList
- Implement [nested navigation with a bottom navigation bar](https://medium.com/@Mr_Pepe/neavigation-with-a-bottom-navigation-bar-using-flutter-d3c5086fbcdc)
- On pressed 'Start' navigate to activity view
- Add dates
- Add Calendar overview
- Use 'expand / collapse' list entry with ExpansionTile class or use details screen to reveal more workout information
- On first App Start, load JSON using isolate in the background
- Use IndexStack to save State of Screens

- ~~: Save selected workout in SharedPreferences~~
- ~~: If workout is not selected, show "Choose you workout!" hint in activity view~~
- ~~: Load JSON when workout is selected and add to Provider~~
